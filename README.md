# Applied Data Visualization with R and ggplot2
When data is presented to you in a graphical or pictorial format, you can analyze it more effectively. This course begins by introducing you to basic concepts, such as grammar of graphics and geometric objects. It then goes on to explain these concepts in detail with examples. Once you are comfortable with basics, you can learn all about the advanced plotting techniques, such as box plots and density plots. With this course, you can transform data into the useful material and make data analysis interesting and fun.


## What you will learn
* Set up the R environment, RStudio, and understand the structure of ggplot2
* Distinguish variables and use best practices to visualize them
* Change visualization defaults to reveal more information about data
* Implement the grammar of graphics in ggplot2 such as scales and faceting
* Build complex and aesthetic visualizations with ggplot2 analysis methods
* Logically and systematically explore complex relationships
* Compare variables in a single visual, with advanced plotting methods
